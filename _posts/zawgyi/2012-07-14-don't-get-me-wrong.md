<p>Did you get yourself into hot water trying out the previous expression? Have you ever been conversing about some interesting matter and realised to your horror that you have been badly misunderstood? You can recover from that using <span class='zawgyi'>မဆိုလို</span>– ‘didn’t mean, didn’t [want to] imply’. We’ll use it after building up a sentence.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ေကာင္းပါတယ္။</span> It’s good.</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ထားတာ ေကာင္းပါတယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It’s good to leave [it].</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ယူထားတာေကာင္းပါတယ္။</span> </p>
<p class='hide-this'>It’s good to get (= take + keep) it.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>မ်ားမ်ားယူထားတာ ေကာင္းပါတယ္။</span> </p>
<p class='hide-this'>It’s good to get a lot.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>တတ္ႏိုင္သေလာက္ မ်ားမ်ားယူထားတာေကာင္းပါတယ္။</span> </p>
<p class='hide-this'>It’s good to get as many as you can.</p>

<p>This one came out of a conversation where one person was standing on tiptoe in the intersection of respect for the intelligence and capacity of people who do not have college degrees, recognition that some people have degrees and are still not very competent, and respect for the value of education. You can imagine this left plenty of possibility for offending conversation partners, despite the opposite intent. No, it wasn’t me. Here was the full clarification, and some colloquial equivalents:</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ဘြဲ႕ယူတာကို အဆိုးမဆိုလိုပါ။ တတ္ႏိုင္သေလာက္ မ်ားမ်ားယူထားတာေကာင္းပါတယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I don’t mean that there’s anything wrong with getting a degree. The more the better!<br>
Don’t get me wrong — I’m not implying that getting a degree isn’t a good thing. By all means, get as many as possible!</p>

<p>You may often hear this after generalisations: [group]<span class='zawgyi'>တိုင္း မဆိုလိုပါ</span>(<span class='zawgyi'>ဘူး</span>). </p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ေယာက္်ားတိုင္း မဆိုလိုပါ။</span> Not all men. Not every man. That’s not to implicate all men.</p>
