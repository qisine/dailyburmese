<p><span class='zawgyi'>ေျပာခ်င္တယ္ခင္ဗ်ာ။</span> I want to say [something].</p>

<p class='my'><span class='zawgyi'>နည္းနည္း ေျပာခ်င္တယ္ခင္ဗ်ာ။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I want to talk a little.</p>

<p class='my'><span class='zawgyi'>နည္းနည္း ေျပာခ်င္ေသးတယ္ခင္ဗ်ာ။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I also want to talk a little.</p>

<p class='my'><span class='zawgyi'>နည္းနည္း ဆက္ေျပာခ်င္ေသးတယ္ခင္ဗ်ာ။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I want to say a little more. [= continue speaking]</p>

<p>In the actual sentence, the speaker wanted his request to seem more innocuous, so he added:<br>
<span class='zawgyi'>နည္းနည္းကေလး ဆက္ေျပာခ်င္ေသးတယ္ခင္ဗ်ာ။</span></p>
