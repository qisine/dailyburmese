<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အရွိန္လြန္လို႔ ကားထိန္းလို႔ မရဘူး။ ေၾကာက္စရာ ေကာင္းတယ္ေနာ။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>The car was out of control, because it was going too fast — that’s frightening, isn’t it.</p>

<p><span class='zawgyi'>ေနာ</span> and <span class='mm3'>ေနာ္</span> are used similarly at the end of a sentence, to evoke agreement, but <span class='mm3'>ေနာ</span> is more emphatic. I put <span class='mm3'>ေၾကာက္စရာေကာင္းတယ္</span> to give you a better chance of</p>
<p>guessing. On the ground, I guess you would be more likely to hear <span class='zawgyi'>ေၾကာက္စရာႀကီးေနာ။</span></p>

<p><span class='zawgyi'>အရွိန္ရ</span>– sounds positive — like ‘gain momentum’</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>အရွိန္ျပင္း</span>– sounds a little dangerous — <span class='mm3'>ျပင္း</span>(+<span class='mm3'>ထန္</span>)– means strong, like strong winds</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>အရွိန္ျမႇင့္</span> / <span class='mm3'>ျမင့္</span>– speed up (active and passive) We have to speed this up. <span class='mm3'>အရွိန္ျမႇင့္ရမယ္။</span></p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>အရွိန္ေလၽွာ႔</span> / <span class='mm3'>ေလ်ာ့</span> slow down (active and passive)</p>
<p>We have to slow down. (drive more slowly) <span class='zawgyi'>အရွိန္ေလၽွာ႔ေမာင္းရမယ္။</span></p>
<p>Momentum has been lost. <span class='zawgyi'>အရွိန္ေလ်ာ့သြားၿပီ။</span></p>
<p>It can also be used with <span class='zawgyi'>နဲ႔၊ ႏွင့္</span> as in  <span class='mm3'>အရွိန္နဲ႔ေျပးတယ္။</span>  He ran speedily.</p>
