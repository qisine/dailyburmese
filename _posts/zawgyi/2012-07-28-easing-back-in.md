<p>Easing back into Daily Burmese, let’s look at some red-and-white sentences. The word for a slogan or motto is <span class='zawgyi'>ေဆာင္ပုဒ္။</span>. You have come across the key verb in this one about a year ago, when there was a flood of Daily Burmeses about high water: <span class='mm3'>ေရလႊမ္းမိုး</span> – is one of the words you can use when an area is under water. Here it is being used in a less concrete sense.</p>

<p>[He’ll] get [it].<span class='zawgyi'> ရမည္။</span></p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><span class='zawgyi'>လႊမ္းရမည္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It will overwhelm.</p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><span class='zawgyi'>ကမၻာကို လႊမ္းရမည္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It will overwhelm the world.</p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><span class='zawgyi'>အားကစား ကမၻာကို လႊမ္းရမည္။</span></p>
