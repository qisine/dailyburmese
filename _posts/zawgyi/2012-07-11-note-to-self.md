<p>I suspect many of you do it this way anyway, and fighting it will just take years off my life.</p>

<p><span class='zawgyi'>ရွင့္</span>/<span class='zawgyi'>ခင္ဗ်ား အသက္ တိုပါတယ္။</span></p>
<p>Your life is shortened.</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ေအာင္ျမင္ေနတာကို ခင္ဗ်ား အသက္တိုပါတယ္။</span></p>

<p class='hide-this'>Your life is shortened by envy of the success of others.</p>

<p><span class='zawgyi'>သူမ်ားေအာင္ျမင္ေနတာကို မနာလိုဝန္တိုမႈေတြနဲ႔ ခင္ဗ်ား အသက္တိုပါတယ္။</span></p>

<p><span class='zawgyi'>တို</span>– really means ‘to be short’ (in length, time, patience, etc, but not in height, that would be <span class='zawgyi'>ပု</span>–). To say ‘shorten’ more clearly, you would say <span class='zawgyi'>တိုေစ</span>–, but here from the context it is clear that it is not about the criticised party’s life already being short.</p>

<p>V<span class='zawgyi'>ေစ</span>– can be added to just about any verb where there is a logical meaning, and it also appears in other expressions. Do you know any of these?</p>
