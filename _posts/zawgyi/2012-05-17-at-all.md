<p>If you are like me, you have been relying on <span class='zawgyi'>လုံးဝ</span> for for a long time when you want to make a strong negative statement.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>လုံးဝ မရွိဘူး။</span> There aren’t any at all.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>လုံးဝပ်က္စီးေနၿပီ။</span> It is completely ruined.</p>
<p>or most frequently <span class='zawgyi'>လုံးဝ မသိဘူး။</span> I haven’t the foggiest.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>လုံးဝ</span> is reliable, easy to remember, and satisfying to say, so why bother with another expression? Well, such is the human heart. <span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုမွ</span> cannot be used in every situation, as it implies something more like ‘in no way’. However, there are many places in which we say ‘what’ in English, but in Burmese the verb is important, so you say ‘how’. So we say ‘What can I say?’ but in Bse it is more likely to be <span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုေျပာရမလဲ။</span> ‘How can I say?’ But in both English and Bse, ‘How can I explain?’ <span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လို ေျပာျပရမလဲ။</span> This opens the way for a strong negative: <span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုမွ ေျပာျပလို႔ မရဘူး။</span> ‘It was impossible to explain.’</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>မမီဘူး။</span> [I] can’t reach [it]. /<span class='zawgyi'>မွီ</span>/</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ေခတ္မမီဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It’s obsolete.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုမွ ေခတ္မမီဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>That’s totally out of date.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အေျပာအဆို ဘယ္လိုမွ ေခတ္မမီဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>What [he] says is way out of date.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အဲဒီအေျပာအဆို ဘယ္လိုမွ ေခတ္မမီဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>That comment is out of step with the times.</p>

<p>Try it out — what are these in Burmese, using <span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုမွ</span>?</p>
<p>It was inedible. <span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုမွ စားလို႔ မရဘူး။</span></p>
<p>[He] could not say another word. <span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုမွ ဆက္ေျပာလို႔ မရဘူး။</span></p>
<p>[We] couldn’t find [it] anywhere. <span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုမွ ရွာမရဘူး။</span></p>
<p>And a tricky one to finish off with:</p>
<p>These children never listen. <span class='zawgyi'>ဒီကေလးေတြ ဘယ္လိုမွ ေျပာမရဘူး။</span></p>
