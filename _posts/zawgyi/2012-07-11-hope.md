<p>The good news is, it looks like the most urgent tasks for me are coming to an end with the end of this month, so I will turn back to Daily Burmese among other neglected amusements. Meanwhile, something a bit different.</p>
<p>We use ‘to hope’ in a loose and kindly way in English, and as we mainly have very lovely encounters with polite Burmese we wish well, we are often wondering how to say ‘to hope’ in Burmese. If you look it up in a dictionary, you will probably find <span class='zawgyi'>ေမၽွာ္လင့္</span>- which is way to the ‘expect/look forward to’ side of ‘hope’. The nouns <span class='zawgyi'>ေမၽွာ္လင့္ခ်က္</span> and 'hope' are closer than the verbs are. Since, culturally, people often express hopes as certainties (I once bought lottery tickets, and the seller assured me I would win, for example), <span class='zawgyi'>ေမၽွာ္လင့္</span>– often works in one sense of ‘hope’, like ‘I hope he’ll be able to visit.’ But it doesn’t make much sense to ‘hope’ for someone else this way, like ‘I hope he gets the job.’ For that, you would express your good wishes by putting out the wish into the universe: [hoped-for event]<span class='zawgyi'>ျဖစ္ပါေစ</span> This <span class='zawgyi'>ပါေစ</span> expression, very familiar in wishes for others, such as anything + Verb + <span class='zawgyi'>ပါေစ။</span> ‘May you verb whatever’. It usually works quite well for the general positive-vibe ‘hope’. In today’s sentence, which is a reaction by a programmer to a crack to some Burmese software, there is a slightly different construction.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ေနာင္ဘဝတြင္</span> - <span class='zawgyi'>တီထြင္ေသာလူမ်ားကို</span> -</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>အားေပးေသာ</span> - <span class='zawgyi'>ေနရာတြင္</span> - <span class='zawgyi'>လူျဖစ္ရ</span> -</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>၍ ခိုးသုံးသူမ်ားအား</span></p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ခိုင္းစားရေသာသူျဖစ္ရ</span> -</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ပါလို၏။</span></p>

<p>in the next life – the people who invent/create –</p>
<p>supportive – place/environment – become a person –</p>
<p>and – people who pirate –</p>
<p>become low-level workers –</p>
<p>it should be</p>
<p>I hope that those who pirate (software) will be reborn to earn by the sweat of their brow, while those who create are appreciated in their next life.</p>

<p><span class='zawgyi'>ခိုး</span>– is ‘steal’, <span class='zawgyi'>ခိုးသုံး</span>– can also be to use secretly too</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ခိုင္း</span>– is to tell someone to do something, V<span class='zawgyi'>စား</span> is to V for a living or to raise needed money</p>
