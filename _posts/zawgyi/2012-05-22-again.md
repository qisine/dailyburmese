<p class='hide-this'>When the power comes at the time it is supposed to, it just keeps cutting out, again and again.</p>

<p>Here is the actual quote, from someone fed up with a lifetime of power cuts:</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>အလွည့္က်ေပးတယ္လို႔သာေျပာတာ။ ဒါေပမဲ့ လာမဲ့အခ်ိန္မွာလည္း မီးအားက လာၿပီးရင္ ခဏခဏ ျပန္ျပန္ျပတ္သြားတာမ်ိဳးေတြ ျဖစ္တယ္။</span></p>
<p>You see I have simplified it slightly at the end. I thought I had done a few examples of this sort of V<span class='zawgyi'>တာမ်ိဳးေတြ ရွိ</span>/<span class='mm3'>ျဖစ္</span>– for you, but it seems not. It is a common way of giving examples or implying that what you have mentioned is just one of many instances you might have chosen.</p>
