<p>Note here the difference in use of plural between English and Burmese. Bse does not need plurals for general statements. In English, you might even say ‘children need tickets’.</p>
<p>In Burmese, in a less formal situation you might say <span class='zawgyi'>ကေလးေတြ လက္မွတ္ဝယ္ရမယ္။</span> But ordinarily, general statements are made without plurals.</p>
