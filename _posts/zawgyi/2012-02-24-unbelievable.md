<p>If I were choosing the signature flavour of Burmans, it would be <span class='zawgyi'>လက္ဖက္</span> pickled tea. Very particular to the Burmans, celebratory, appealing, healthful, associated with resolution of conflict, puts all in a good mood, vegetarian... It just goes to show why I do not get a vote in such matters that in fact the universally recognised taste symbol of the Burmans is fermented fishpaste, <span class='zawgyi'>ငါးပိ</span> /<span class='zawgyi'>ငပိ</span>/. When Burmese talk about the way they speak English, they do not say Burglish (<span class='zawgyi'>ျမန္ဂလိပ္</span>?) but <span class='zawgyi'>ငါးပိသံနဲ႔ ေျပာတယ္။ ငါးပိသံ ပါတယ္။</span></p>
<p>Well, enough of that. We are exercising <span class='zawgyi'>ျငင္း</span>– again today. As with other words spelled with <span class='zawgyi'>ျင</span> there is no need to strain your throat to add a ya sound to a nga. Just relax and pronounce it /<span class='zawgyi'>ည</span>/<span class='zawgyi'>။</span></p>

<p><span class='zawgyi'>မယုံဘူး။</span>  [He] didn’t believe [it].</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>လုံးဝ မယုံဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>He absolutely couldn’t believe it. (just add an intensifier: not at all)</p>

<p>He found it unbelievable that she declined to eat fishpaste.</p>

<p class='hide-this'>He said he just could not believe that she was refusing to eat fishpaste.</p>
