<p>As I have been remiss lately, today there is one sentence with a lot to look at. It was lifted from a newspaper editorial, and is in somewhat formal style.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>သင့္ပါသည္။</span> [That’s the way it] should be.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ထားသင့္ပါသည္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>[It] should be left.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ရွိထားသင့္ပါသည္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>[I] should have [something].</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ဖုန္းတစ္လုံး ရွိထားသင့္ပါသည္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I should have a phone. (count phones with <span class='zawgyi'>လုံး</span>)</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>မိုဘိုင္းလ္ဖုန္းတစ္လုံး ရွိထားသင့္ပါသည္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I should have a mobile phone.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>လူတစ္ေယာက္ မိုဘိုင္းလ္ဖုန္းတစ္လုံးေတာ့ ရွိထားသင့္ပါသည္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>A person should have a mobile phone. (add a <span class='zawgyi'>ေတာ့</span> after the <span class='zawgyi'>ဖုန္းတစ္လုံး</span>)</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အ႐ြယ္ေရာက္သူ လူတစ္ေယာက္ မိုဘိုင္းလ္ဖုန္းတစ္လုံးေတာ့ ရွိထားသင့္ပါသည္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>An adult (= a person who has come of age) should have a mobile phone.</p>

<p>Now that is the learner-friendly, particle-impoverished version that is understandable, clear, etc, but missing some flavour. Here is the sentence as it appeared:</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>အ႐ြယ္ေရာက္သူ လူတစ္ဦးတစ္ေယာက္အတြက္ မိုဘိုင္းလ္ဖုန္းတစ္လုံးေလာက္ေတာ့ ရွိထားသင့္ပါသည္။</span></p>

<p>Let’s look at what is missing from the simpler sentence, starting from the left.</p>

<p>– <span class='zawgyi'>ေတာ့</span> is rapidly becoming my favourite particle (replacing <span class='zawgyi'>ေရာ</span>). Here, I just feel it gives a satisfying firmness to the statement, implying that the writer is prepared to defend it. In that way, it is a bit like ‘actually’ in English, though that word does not fit in this sentence, either.</p>
<p>– <span class='zawgyi'>ေလာက္</span> which you are undoubtedly familiar with as ‘approximately, around, about’ here just marks that a number has come up. You can also hear people ordering <span class='zawgyi'>ထမင္းတစ္ပြဲေလာက္</span> and I am sure they know just how many bowls of rice they will get.</p>
<p>– Notice that no grammatical markers of subject / object are necessary.</p>
<p>– <span class='zawgyi'>အတြက္</span>  you probably know well as ‘for’ </p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ဖုန္းတစ္လုံးေလာက္ ခ်စ္သူအတြက္ ဝယ္ထားတယ္။</span> [I] bought a phone for my girl/boyfriend.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ဒီစာအုပ္ ကိုေအာင္အတြက္ သိမ္းထားတယ္။ေတာ့</span>          This book is being kept for Ko Aung.</p>
<p>In today’s sentence <span class='zawgyi'>အတြက္</span> doesn’t get translated into English, but you can see how without literally meaning ‘for’ there is a sense of ‘for every person’ which doesn’t happen to work in English in this sentence the way it is cast.</p>
<p>– Most people I know call a mobile phone a <span class='zawgyi'>ဟန္းဖုန္း</span> ‘hand phone’, but this <span class='zawgyi'>မိုဘိုင္းလ္</span> is not uncommon, though the silent <span class='zawgyi'>လ္</span> to represent the English L is unusual. They also recommend you carry a notebook and a <span class='zawgyi'>ေဘာလ္ပင္</span> to note phone numbers with, so maybe they just have a thing for <span class='zawgyi'>လ္</span></p>
<p>Using both <span class='zawgyi'>တစ္ဦး</span> and <span class='zawgyi'>တစ္ေယာက္</span> makes the <span class='zawgyi'>လူ</span> general — it is not one adult who needs a phone, but people.</p>
<p>From an editorial in the New Light of Myanmar, headline <span class='zawgyi'>မိုဘိုင္းလ္ဖုန္းတစ္လုံး ဘယ္လိုသုံးမလဲ ျမန္မာ့အလင္း ၂၀၁၂ ေမ ၃၁</span> http://www.myanmar.com/newspaper/myanmarahlin/May31.pdf page 2</p>
<p>If someone were really saying this in English, it would be a lot shorter, of course. Something like:</p>
<p>Everyone should have a mobile phone!</p>
<p>All adults should have mobile phones!</p>
<p>Grownups have mobiles.</p>
<p>One man, one phone.</p>
