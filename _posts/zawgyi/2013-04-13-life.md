<p>This probably won't last, but here's another:</p>

<p>What’s [it] like? How? <span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုလဲ။</span></p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ဘဝ ဘယ္လိုလဲ။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>What is life like?</p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>လူ႕ဘဝ ဘယ္လိုလဲ။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>What is human life like? (Don’t forget to make the <span class='zawgyi'>လူ</span> possessive)</p>

<p>No, today has been serious enough. Let’s start over.</p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ဘယ္လိုပတ္သက္ေနပါသလဲ။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>What does [that] have to do with [it]. How are these related?</p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>လူ႕ဘဝနဲ႔ ဘယ္လိုပတ္သက္ေနပါသလဲ။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>What does that have to do with life?</p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ေျမပုံေတြက လူ႕ဘဝနဲ႔ ဘယ္လိုပတ္သက္ေန သလဲ။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>What do maps have to do with life?</p>

<p>I can’t pinpoint why, but this question is usually asked with <span class='zawgyi'>ေန။</span></p>
<p>You do not have to use <span class='zawgyi'>ပတ္သက္</span> in your answer, but you will likely use <span class='mm3'>လို</span>as in:<br>
<span class='zawgyi'>ေျမပုံလိုပဲ လူ႕ဘဝဟာ </span>...</p>

<p>Some more examples, including <span class='zawgyi'>ပတ္သက္</span> with <span class='mm3'>လို႔</span> and <span class='mm3'>ၿပီး</span> which mean the same here:</p>
<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ဒီကိစၥနဲ႔ပတ္သက္ၿပီး သတင္း မထြက္ေသးဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>No news has come out regarding this matter yet.</p>
<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ေျမပုံနဲ႔ ပတ္သက္လို႔ သိပ္ မစဥ္းစားရေသးဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I haven’t thought much about maps yet.</p>
<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အသံဖမ္းစက္နဲ႔ ပတ္သက္တဲ့ စာအုပ္မရွိဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I don’t have any books relating to recording equipment.</p>
