<p><span class='zawgyi'>မလိုဘူး။</span> [It] is not necessary.</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ခ်စ္ဖို႔ မလိုဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It’s not necessary to love.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အမ်ိဳးကို ခ်စ္ဖို႔ မလိုဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It is not necessary to love a people. (use ‘a kind’ for ‘a people’)</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ကိုယ့္အမ်ိဳးကို ခ်စ္ဖို႔ မလိုဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It is not necessary to love your own people. (Don’t forget the possessive creak)</p>

<p>Hmmm. Let’s try again.</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>မလိုဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It’s not necessary.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>မုန္းဖို႔မလိုဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It is not necessary to hate.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အမ်ိဳးကို မုန္းဖို႔ မလိုဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>It is not necessary to hate a people.</p>

<p>Okay, let’s look at the whole sentence, a quote from a 1944 speech by Aung San:</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ကိုယ့္အမ်ိဳးကို ခ်စ္႐ုံနဲ႔ ဒီ့ျပင္အမ်ိဳးကိုလည္း မုန္းဖို႔ မလိုဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>You don’t have to hate others just because you love your own people.</p>

<p><span class='zawgyi'>အမ်ိဳး</span> here means <span class='zawgyi'>လူမ်ိဳး</span> but in other contexts can also mean <span class='zawgyi'>ေဆြမ်ိဳး</span> (relatives) and other ‘kinds’. It does not match exactly any English word like ethnic group, nationality, etc. I like people because it is equally ambiguous in English, though it won't work everywhere.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>႐ုံ</span> gives a sense of exclusivity, like ‘only, just’ which is not quite captured by the ‘just’ in this sentence. The <span class='zawgyi'>နဲ႔</span> makes it instrumental, with the idea if not the word because. You can just love your own people, you don’t have to hate others. Loving your own people doesn’t imply you hate others. You don’t have to hate other peoples just because you love your own.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ဒီ့ျပင္</span> You might have said the more proper <span class='zawgyi'>အျပင္</span> but <span class='zawgyi'>ဒီ့ျပင္</span> (usually written <span class='zawgyi'>ဒီျပင္</span> with a spoken but unwritten creaky tone) is more colloquial.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>လည္း</span> brings attention to the contrast between the two phrases, and links with <span class='zawgyi'>နဲ႔</span>.</p>
