<p>Some words may be new to you.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ပန္းတိုင္</span> You know very well that <span class='zawgyi'>ပန္း</span> means flower and <span class='zawgyi'>တိုင္</span> means post.</p>
<p>What happens when you put them together? In the past, the finish line at races was marked by a flower-adorned post. These days it is more likely to be metaphorical, a goal.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>မွန္း</span>– is to aim, and thus by extention to expect, to intend. (It also means to estimate, guess). So what do you think happens to it when you pair it with <span class='zawgyi'>ေမၽွာ္</span>– (expect, hope)?</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ေရာက္မယ္။</span> [I]’ll arrive</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ေရာက္ရမယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I’ll get [there].</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ပန္းတိုင္ ေရာက္ရမယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I’ll reach [my] goal.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>မွန္းတဲ့ ပန္းတိုင္ ေရာက္ရမယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I’ll reach the goal [I] have set.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>တေန႔ေတာ့ မွန္းတဲ့ ပန္းတိုင္ ေရာက္ရမယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>One day I’ll reach the goal I have set.</p>

<p>Now I suppose you are a bit disappointed that <span class='zawgyi'>ေမၽွာ္</span>– has not appeared. <span class='zawgyi'>ေမၽွာ္</span>– by itself is most commonly come across in the meaning of ‘expect, hope’. But this rests on its literal meaning of ‘look into the distance’. (Thus the word for ‘watchtower’ <span class='zawgyi'>ေမၽွာ္စင္</span>) So when you add <span class='zawgyi'>ေမၽွာ္</span>– it gives the sense that the goal was not set rationally and coldly, but is something that is more eagerly awaited. A hope, an aspiration. The difference is that in English, we don’t ‘reach’ our hopes in the same way, they just come about or not. So go ahead and add it, keeping the Burmese metaphor in mind.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>တေန႔ေတာ့ ေမၽွာ္မွန္းတဲ့ ပန္းတိုင္ ေရာက္ရမယ္။</span></p>
