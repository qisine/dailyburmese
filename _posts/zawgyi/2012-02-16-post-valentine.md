<p>Note the use of <span class='zawgyi'>ႀကီး</span> here. Often adding <span class='zawgyi'>ႀကီး</span> to something is a mark of respect for something great, grand, etc: <span class='zawgyi'>ဆရာႀကီး၊ နာမည္ႀကီး။</span> But it can also give something a negative tinge, the same way <span class='zawgyi'>ေလး</span> can give a positive one. It is always <span class='zawgyi'>ခ်စ္စရာေလး</span> for example. Listen for <span class='zawgyi'>ႀကီး</span> and <span class='zawgyi'>ေလး</span> used in this way. You might hear N<span class='zawgyi'>ႀကီး</span> or N+descriptive verb+<span class='zawgyi'>ႀကီး</span> like <span class='zawgyi'>ဒီအခ်ိန္ႀကီး</span> this (inappropriate) time; <span class='zawgyi'>အနံ႔ဆိုးႀကီး</span> stench</p>
