<p><span class='zawgyi'>လြဲ</span>– is a very handy word. As well as meaning ‘go wrong’, it also means ‘to miss’, as in ‘to miss the mark’, ‘to miss the target’. <span class='zawgyi'>လမ္းလြဲေနတယ္</span> is one of the ways to say that you are lost, took the wrong path, metaphorically and occasionally geographically as well. (<span class='zawgyi'>လမ္းလႊဲ</span> is a detour.)</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>နားလည္မႈလြဲတယ္</span> is to misunderstand. It is also used in other compounds for mistakes and differences.</p>
