<p>Original headline:</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ပဲခူးဟံသာဝတီ အျပည္ျပည္ဆိုင္ရာ ေလဆိပ္စီမံကိန္း ျပန္လည္ စတင္မည့္ အစီအစဥ္ရွိေၾကာင္း သိရ</span> </p>
<p class='hide-this'>The headline (from Weekly Eleven, Sept 2011 http://tiny.tw/aLx) is in written style.</p>

<p>The <span class='zawgyi'>ေၾကာင္း</span> is a marker for reported information. The <span class='mm3'>သိရ</span> is a typical way to indicate that something was not witnessed. You may have noted this in translations as ‘it is known’ added to information that someone is relaying from a source. In English, we would normally say ‘according to Source X...’ but in Burmese the source is naturally left unmentioned, and so the <span class='mm3'>သိရ</span> is left an orphan, and senseless to translate without a source. </p>
<p>In speech, you might casually say <span class='zawgyi'>ျပန္စမယ္။</span> Adding <span class='mm3'>လည္</span> doesn’t change the fundamental meaning, but makes it a bit more weighty. </p>
<p>Some people prefer to spell this <span class='zawgyi'>မဲ့</span> as <span class='mm3'>မယ့္</span> in this case; the former is formed in parallel to <span class='mm3'>တဲ့ ေပးတဲ့ဆု ေပးမဲ့ဆု</span> and the latter in parallel to the written form <span class='mm3'>မည့္။</span></p>
