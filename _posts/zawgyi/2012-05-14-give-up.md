<p>Nothing special for today, either, but two hints at the top.</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ေလၽွာ႔လိုက္တယ္။</span>  [She] reduced it. /<span class='mm3'>ေယွာ႔</span>/</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>လက္ေလၽွာ႔လိုက္တယ္။</span>  [She] gave up.</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ကၽြန္ေတာ္က လက္ေလၽွာ႔လိုက္တယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I gave up.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ကၽြန္ေတာ္တို႔က လက္ေလၽွာ႔လိုက္တယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>We gave up.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>လူမ်ားေတာ့ ကၽြန္ေတာ္တို႔က လက္ေလၽွာ႔လိုက္တယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>There were a lot of people, so we gave up.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>လူမ်ားေတာ့ ကၽြန္ေတာ္တို႔ဘက္က လက္ေလၽွာ႔လိုက္တယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>There were a lot of people, so our side backed down.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>သူတို႔ဘက္က လူမ်ားေတာ့ ကၽြန္ေတာ္တို႔ဘက္က လက္ေလၽွာ႔လိုက္တယ္။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>Their side had more people, so our side backed down.</p>

<p>Notice the use of <span class='zawgyi'>က</span> here is not just the subject marker, but in the first case <span class='mm3'>သူတို႔ဘက္က</span> 'on their side' and in the latter <span class='mm3'>ကၽြန္ေတာ္တို႔ဘက္က</span> is more just for emphasis of separation or difference, as the context makes clear who backs down.</p>
