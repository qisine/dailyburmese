<p>Backwards this time:</p>
<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အလွည့္</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>Turn (as in, ‘Whose turn is it?’)</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အလွည့္က်</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>By turns</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အလွည့္က်ေပးတယ္</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>Give it by turns.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>အလွည့္က်ေပးတယ္လို႔ေျပာ</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>[They] say they give it by turns.</p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a>Okay, now what we want to say here is: They only say they give it by turns. What they say is they give it by turns. Ostensibly they give it by turns. You are going to add a <span class='zawgyi'>သာ</span> and a <span class='zawgyi'>တာ</span>‌, in two places, not necessarily in that order.</p>
<p class='hide-this'><span class='zawgyi'>အလွည့္က်ေပးတယ္လို႔သာေျပာတာ။</span></p>

<p>If you’ve ever lived in Burma, I suppose you have guessed long ago what we are talking about here: electricity, and rolling blackouts.</p>

<p>To be continued.</p>
