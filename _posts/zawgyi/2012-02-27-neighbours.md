<p>You remember how to say ‘disagree, dispute’, right? Well, usually the two parts of that verb are together, but they don’t have to be. It gives a certain pleasing rhythm and emphasis to separate the parts as well: <span class='zawgyi'>ျငင္းၾက ခုံၾက</span>– ‘everyone was disagreeing/arguing/disputing’</p>
<p><span class='zawgyi'>ရတယ္။</span> It’s okay.</p>
