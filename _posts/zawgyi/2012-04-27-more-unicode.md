<p>Alright, I have finished many of my obligations, so let’s start ramping back up to full sentences. Among the things I have done in the last week is upgrade to OS10.7, which integrates Myanmar Unicode into the operating system. So even if you type in one of the default system fonts, and switch to Myanmar Unicode typing, the text comes out correctly. But still, not every font works in every application. If this doesn't show up correctly for you, let me know and I'll switch back to my old system. </p>
<p>Anyway, one more step of progress. It took Thailand about 10 years to transition to Unicode, and now no one thinks of using anything else. Well not no one, but you could count the people who use legacy fonts on your fingers.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, how do you say ‘count’ in Burmese? </p>
<p>And while you are remembering words, what about the word for ‘broken’ Not ruined, or not working but, say snapped in two, like a broken arm. Well, that is <span class='zawgyi'>က်ိဳး</span>– like <span class='mm3'>လက္က်ိဳးသြားတယ္။</span> So the active version, if you break something, is <span class='mm3'>ခ်ိဳး</span>– which also means a number of other things, including fold.Have you noticed how Burmese people count on their fingers? They start with all their fingers up, and then start with the little finger, bend it down with a finger on the other hand, and say ‘First, ….’ So guess what the verb for that is? <span class='mm3'>လက္ခ်ိဳး</span>–  (which also means ‘to crack the knuckles’) So can you figure out this phrase? </p>

<p class="hide-trigger"><a href='#'>+</a><span class='zawgyi'>လက္ခ်ိဳးေရလို႔ရတဲ့ လူနည္းစု</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>In case you didn’t remember, the verb for count is <span class='zawgyi'>ေရ</span>–</p>

<p>In case you haven’t got it yet, <span class='zawgyi'>နည္း</span>– is the verb, pronounced /<span class='mm3'>နဲ</span>/ to be few, to be little and <span class='mm3'>စု</span>– means to gather. So <span class='mm3'>လူနည္းစု</span> means ‘a minority’.</p>
<p>Can you see how it means: a minority which can be counted on the fingers.</p>
