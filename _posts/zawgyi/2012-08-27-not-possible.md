<p><span class='zawgyi'>လုံးဝ</span> is a strong emphasis normally used with negative verbs. It is occasionally used for positive emphasis as well. There is a negative verb in the sentence, but the <span class='zawgyi'>လုံးဝ</span> does not apply to it.</p>

<p>That is not possible.<span class='zawgyi'> မရပါဘူး။</span></p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>ေျပာလို႔မရပါဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>You can’t say it is true.</p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>မွန္တယ္လို႔ ေျပာလို႔မရဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>You cannot say it is entirely true.</p>

<p class='hide-trigger'><a href="#">+</a><span class='zawgyi'>လုံးဝမွန္တယ္လို႔ေတာ့ ေျပာလို႔မရပါဘူး။</span></p>
<p class='hide-this'>I would say that this is not entirely true.</p>
